# homework-1 challenge

I first assesed the html doc

Then i went and veiwed the style.css sheet to see what was wrong with it. 

I then noticed that the style sheet the html was linking to was blank.

After finding that out I then went over and started styleing my css sheet.

Adding image height of 1,2 and 3 to 200px.

Then adding image height of 3,4 and 5 to 150px.

after noticing the heading i then went into the style sheet and changed the text size so it would match better.

I then changed the background color of the header to color #2a607c.

Then changing the header text to #ffffff.

Changed footer padding to 30px.

Used flex-end to try and display the text in the header to go to the right.

changed url to Horieson.com.
